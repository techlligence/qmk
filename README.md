# QMK for ducky one 2 mini
This 'fork' has the main purpose to get qmk to compile for the ducky one 2 mini. This was accomplished by following this thread: https://dev.to/skydevht/i-wanna-hack-my-keyboard-4e7f. I was brave enough to flash it and it worked! (specifically for the 1861st model). I have made a few more edits here and there to ensure that it builds. In order to build the bin, simply run 'make ducky/one2mini:default' or 'make ducky/one2mini:ansi' if you want that layout. To flash your ducky on 2 mini, pull out the usb type c cable, hold D + L on the keyboard to place it in bootloader mode. In order to flash the keyboard, you will need the python tool 'nuvoton-isp', so install it using 'pip install --user nuvoton-isp'. To flash the bin, simply run 'sudo nuvoisp -f ducky_one2mini_default.bin'. Unplug your keyboard and replug in the cable to boot in normal mode. Done!
